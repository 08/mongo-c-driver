MongoDB C Driver Documentation
============================================

Overview
--------

The MongoDB C Driver is the 10gen-supported driver for MongoDB.
It's written in pure C. The goal is to be super strict for ultimate
portability, no dependencies, and generic embeddability.

The driver is still considered alpha but is undergoing active
development. Support for replica sets was just added in v0.3.
